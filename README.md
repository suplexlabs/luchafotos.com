# LuchaFotos.com

LuchaFotos was a project that I built which helped users find photos of wrestlers, events, etc across multiple
companies. It is no longer live as I no longer wanted to invest resources maintaining it.

Originally the site made API calls to a Laravel backend. That backend would check various websites for images similar to
Google Images but obviously on a smaller scale.

That backedn is gone and now what remains is a simple SvelteKit & TypeScript with mock data to give any an idea of how
it used to work.

## Site Features

- Hokmepage to display feed of images
- Search, with Autocomplete, for images based on wrestler name.
- Tagging support for all images.
